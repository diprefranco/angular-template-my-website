## Demo
https://diprefranco.github.io/angular-template-my-website/

## Site
The site shows a header followed by the main section (hero section) to catch users attention.

After that, we have:
- A section with sample images.
- A section with cards.
- A section with two buttons to show additional information.

At the end, we have the footer showing the site icon, links and the contact svg icons.
All the site is **responsive** (it adjusts to different screen sizes).

## Usage
After you clone this repo to your local machine, go to its root directory and run `npm install` to install its dependencies.
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run  `npm start` to start the application.

## Versions
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.2.
