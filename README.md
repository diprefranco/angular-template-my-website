## Website Overview
The site shows a header followed by the main section (hero section) to catch users attention.

After that, we have:
- A section with sample images.
- A section with a timeline.
- A section with cards.
- A section with two buttons to show additional information.

The footer contains the site icon, navigation links, and contact icons. The entire site is **responsive** and adjusts to different screen sizes.

## Usage
To run the site locally, clone this repository and navigate to the root directory. Then, install the dependencies with:<br />
`npm install`

Start the application with:<br />
`npm start`
